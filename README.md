# Finding A Treasure - Instant Lottery Game

This repository has a computer software that populates the variables for this game based in the result.

Program was coded in Pascal and can be opened with Embarcadero Delphi.

Delphi Community Edition may be the free compiler you need -> https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter?aldSet=en-GB

I included in this repository a copy of the Windows 32-bit compiled executable as well as a scan of this file.

This executable is ready to be used.

Enjoy the code!
